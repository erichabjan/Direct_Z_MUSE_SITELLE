These files are all **test** code and may be useful to trying to understand the packages used in this analysis. 

**PhysQuans_sandbox.ipynb** This file is used to test different diagnostics for line ratios in PyNeb and to test how different methods of the extraction of the [OII]3727 feature affect the resultant physical quantities. 

**development_Sandbox.ipynb** This file is used to understand how to use the ORBS analysis pacakge and to learn how to interact with the SITELLE data cube. The code that is used to extract spectra from the SITELLE data cube stems from this notebook. 

**SkyBackground_sandbox.ipynb** This file is used to test how to extract a sky background spectrum on a per pixel basis using the ORBS analysis package and how to subtract the sky background from an HII region spectrum, that can then be used to extract an [OII]3727 flux. 

**fitting_sandbox.ipynb** This file tests using the ORBS analysis package to fit the [OII]3727 feature. Initially we had hoped to fit both the [OII]3726,3729 features, though we found this to be quite difficult and did not produce reliable flux or temperature values. We see code to fit both of the [OII]3726,3729 features as well as the blended [OII]3727 feature. We also see my results compared to another member of the PHANGS collaboration.

**SIGNALS_comparison.ipynb** This file compares my results to the results from the SIGNALS survey: NGC628 with SITELLE: I. Imaging spectroscopy of 4285 H II region candidates.
